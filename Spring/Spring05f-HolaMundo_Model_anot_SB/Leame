By default, Spring Boot serves static content from a directory called
 /static (or /public or /resources or /META-INF/resources) in the classpath
  or from the root of the ServletContext. 
  
  It uses the ResourceHttpRequestHandler from Spring MVC so that you can 
  modify that behavior by adding your own WebMvcConfigurer and overriding 
  the addResourceHandlers method.
